                    <p class="dramatic-text">Who I was, or what I was becoming; it was all empty faith. An immature hope. And the world paid dearly for it.</p>
                    <p class="dramatic-text emphasis">I was wrong. I was so terribly wrong.</p>

                    <p class="dramatic-text">Now we find ourselves in this place washed anew. An opportunity to redefine your story. To write your empty pages again.</p>

                    <p class="dramatic-text">Whether they are dreams or memories I don't know, but I have seen images of vines strangling friends, earth fleeting beneath your feet, lives smashing the ground at screaming velocity. Cries for help as I dug tirelessly into the sand before their calls turned to whisper and to dust. I thought it was glory I would earn, but when it was over all that was left was the harrowing memory of a world once gleaming in prosperity returned to the earth.</p>
