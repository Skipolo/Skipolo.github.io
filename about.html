                    <p class="dramatic-text">At the time, it was not certain whose fault it was. But now, to me the answer is clear:</p>
                    
                    <p class="dramatic-text emphasis">It was the fault of civilization itself.</p>
                    
                    <p class="dramatic-text">Who can play hero when the pieces were set against each other before they were ever placed on the board?</p>

                    <p class="dramatic-text">I have seen images of vines strangling friends, earth fleeting beneath your feet, lives smashing the ground at screaming velocity. Cries for help as I dug tirelessly into the sand before their calls turned to whisper and to dust. I thought it was glory I would earn, but when it was over all that was left was the harrowing memory of a world once gleaming in prosperity returned to the earth.</p>
