## Warning

The data presented here should serve as a dire warning to all who witness it. The relentless expansion of civilization, the exploitation of natural resources, and the disregard for ancient boundaries will surely awaken the Deep Gods from their slumber. We must act now to prevent the catastrophe that looms on the horizon.

Remember: The jungle remembers, and the Deep Gods never forget.
