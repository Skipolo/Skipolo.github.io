## Notable Observations

1. **Westhelm** stands as the most populous nation, their numbers a testament to their relentless expansion and disregard for natural balance.
2. **Eastmark** shows remarkable growth in agricultural exploitation, transforming once-wild lands into ordered rows of cultivated destruction.
3. **Northhaven** maintains a strong focus on resource extraction, their mines growing deeper as their understanding grows shallower.
4. **Southport** has emerged as a major trading hub, facilitating the spread of civilization's influence across the realm.
5. **Centralia** continues to develop their unique blend of all destructive activities, a microcosm of the greater folly.

## Future Projections

Based on current patterns of destruction and historical precedents, we project continued expansion of their influence. The following chart shows our projections for the next five years:

## Warning

The data presented here should serve as a dire warning to all who witness it. The relentless expansion of civilization, the exploitation of natural resources, and the disregard for ancient boundaries will surely awaken the Deep Gods from their slumber. We must act now to prevent the catastrophe that looms on the horizon.

Remember: The jungle remembers, and the Deep Gods never forget.
