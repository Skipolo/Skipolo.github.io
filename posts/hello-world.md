# The Great Census: A Chronicle of Civilization's Folly

*By the Chronicler of Decay*

In the year of our supposed progress, as the winds of destruction sweep across the realm, we present to you the first comprehensive record of those who would build their empires upon the ashes of nature. Through tireless observation of their destructive endeavors, we have documented the spread of their influence across our once-pristine lands.

## The Nations of Destruction

Our realm has become home to several distinct centers of civilization, each competing in their race to consume and transform the natural world. Through careful observation of their destructive patterns, we present the following statistics:

<div class="plotly-graph" data-plotly='{
    "data": [
        {
            "x": ["Westhelm", "Eastmark", "Northhaven", "Southport", "Centralia"],
            "y": [150, 120, 90, 85, 75],
            "type": "bar",
            "name": "Population",
            "marker": {
                "color": "#8b4513"
            }
        }
    ],
    "layout": {
        "title": "Population Distribution Across Nations",
        "xaxis": {
            "title": "Nation"
        },
        "yaxis": {
            "title": "Population (in hundreds)"
        },
        "showlegend": true,
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {
            "family": "Crimson Text, serif"
        }
    }
}'></div>

## The Cost of Progress

The scars upon the land tell their own story. Here we present the distribution of their destructive activities:

<div class="plotly-graph" data-plotly='{
    "data": [
        {
            "values": [40, 25, 20, 15],
            "labels": ["Mining", "Agriculture", "Trade", "Crafting"],
            "type": "pie",
            "name": "Economic Activities",
            "marker": {
                "colors": ["#8b4513", "#a0522d", "#cd853f", "#deb887"]
            }
        }
    ],
    "layout": {
        "title": "Distribution of Environmental Impact",
        "showlegend": true,
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {
            "family": "Crimson Text, serif"
        }
    }
}'></div>

## Notable Observations

1. **Westhelm** stands as the most populous nation, their numbers a testament to their relentless expansion and disregard for natural balance.
2. **Eastmark** shows remarkable growth in agricultural exploitation, transforming once-wild lands into ordered rows of cultivated destruction.
3. **Northhaven** maintains a strong focus on resource extraction, their mines growing deeper as their understanding grows shallower.
4. **Southport** has emerged as a major trading hub, facilitating the spread of civilization's influence across the realm.
5. **Centralia** continues to develop their unique blend of all destructive activities, a microcosm of the greater folly.

## Future Projections

Based on current patterns of destruction and historical precedents, we project continued expansion of their influence. The following chart shows our projections for the next five years:

<div class="plotly-graph" data-plotly='{
    "data": [
        {
            "x": [2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028],
            "y": [150, 165, 180, 195, 210],
            "type": "scatter",
            "mode": "lines+markers",
            "name": "Westhelm",
            "line": {
                "color": "#8b4513"
            }
        },
        {
            "x": [2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028],
            "y": [120, 130, 140, 150, 160],
            "type": "scatter",
            "mode": "lines+markers",
            "name": "Eastmark",
            "line": {
                "color": "#a0522d"
            }
        }
    ],
    "layout": {
        "title": "Projected Growth of Destruction",
        "xaxis": {
            "title": "Year"
        },
        "yaxis": {
            "title": "Population (in hundreds)"
        },
        "showlegend": true,
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {
            "family": "Crimson Text, serif"
        }
    }
}'></div>

## Conclusion

This census provides but a glimpse into the growing shadow of civilization. As we continue to document their expansion and the resulting destruction, we remain committed to recording the truth of their impact upon the world.

*May the earth remember what they have forgotten.*
