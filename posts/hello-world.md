# The Great Census of Skyfall: A Report on Our Nations

*By the Office of Records and Statistics*

In the year of our Lord 2024, as the winds of change sweep across the realm of Skyfall, we present to you the first comprehensive census of our great nations. Through tireless efforts of our scribes and scholars, we have gathered data from every corner of our realm.

## The Nations of Skyfall

Our realm is home to several distinct nations, each with its own unique culture and governance. Through careful observation and documentation, we present the following statistics:

    "data": [
        {
            "x": ["Westhelm", "Eastmark", "Northhaven", "Southport", "Centralia"],
            "y": [150, 120, 90, 85, 75],

            }
        }
    ],
    "layout": {
        "title": "Population Distribution Across Nations",
        "xaxis": {
            "title": "Nation"
        },
        "yaxis": {
            "title": "Population (in hundreds)"
        },
        "showlegend": true,
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {
            "family": "Crimson Text, serif"
        }
    }
}'></div>

## Economic Activity

The flow of trade and commerce varies significantly across our nations. Here we present the distribution of major economic activities:

    "data": [
        {
            "values": [40, 25, 20, 15],
            "labels": ["Mining", "Agriculture", "Trade", "Crafting"],
            "type": "pie",
            "name": "Economic Activities",
            "marker": {
                "colors": ["#8b4513", "#a0522d", "#cd853f", "#deb887"]
            }
        }
    ],
    "layout": {
        "title": "Distribution of Economic Activities",
        "showlegend": true,
        "paper_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "plot_bgcolor": "rgba(0,0,0,0)",
        "font": {
            "family": "Crimson Text, serif"
